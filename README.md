Candy Machine User Interface Setup Guide

Introduction
This guide offers a detailed walkthrough for configuring your Candy Machine's user interface (UI). The UI serves as the platform for minting NFTs using the SPL token generated, with users employing their Phantom wallets for the minting process.

Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. A configured Candy Machine with specific details outlined in its config.json file, including price, quantity, symbol, seller fee basis points, SPL token account, SPL token, go-live date, and creator details.
2. A Phantom wallet designated for minting.
3. A newly created SPL token.

Steps
1. SPL Token Setup
If not completed already, follow Lesson Three guidelines to create the SPL token and make a note of its address.

2. Update Candy Machine Config
Edit the config.json file of your Candy Machine and update the following fields:

- splTokenAccount: Replace it with the address of the created SPL token account.
- splToken: Replace it with the SPL token address.

3. UI Configuration
Refer to the "Quick Node: Set Up a Minting Site" tutorial for instructions on creating a UI for your Candy Machine. This UI enables users to connect their Phantom wallets and mint NFTs using the SPL token for payment.

4. Adjust Minting Logic
In your SPL project's minting logic (as per Lesson Three), make necessary modifications to either mint NFTs to the Phantom wallet address or adapt the transfer function to deliver minted NFTs to your Phantom wallet.

5. Testing
Thoroughly test the entire setup by transferring or minting your SPL token to a Phantom account. Utilize the UI to mint NFTs, ensuring a seamless process for users paying with the designated SPL token.
